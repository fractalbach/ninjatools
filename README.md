# ninjatools

Ninjatools is a bunch of code that does various things that are useful in
certain specific situations.  Sometimes, these specific situations arise often
enough that it is nice to have a simple tool.


Currently, Ninjatools is like a those sets of plastic utensils: it contains
a plastic fork, spoon, knife, and napkin.  It gets the job done, but 
will mostly likely break if you try using it to eat a steak.  


If you want to use one of these tools, then you probably only need 1, and 
not this whole repository.  Using the simile above, you might only need a spoon,
but you are given this whole set of utensils anyway.
